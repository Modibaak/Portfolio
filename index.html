        <h3>I'm a <span>Marketing Graduate and Aspiring Full-Stack Developer</span></h3>

        <p>
  Hello! I am a Marketing graduate from the Cape Peninsula University of Technology, where I completed my Advanced Diploma in Marketing in 2023. My background is grounded in marketing strategy and business principles, with a growing focus on web development and technology.
</p>

<p>
  Since 2019, I have been blogging on WordPress about branding, student life, and digital culture. This experience naturally expanded into content creation on TikTok, where I develop mock campaigns, experiment with trends, and create engaging content aimed at improving brand visibility and audience connection.
</p>

<p>
  In my spare time, I actively pursue online courses to support both professional and personal growth. My key areas of interest include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Market Information & Analytics (Quantitative and Qualitative Research)</li>
  <li>Management and Finance for Marketers</li>
  <li>Branding and Communication</li>
  <li>UX and UI Design</li>
  <li>Front-End Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)</li>
  <li>Copywriting</li>
  <li>Additional subjects that strengthen marketing and technical expertise</li>
</ul>


        <p>I am passionate about combining creativity with strategy to build meaningful digital experiences and impactful marketing campaigns.</p>
