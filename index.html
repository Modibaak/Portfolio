            <h2 class="heading">About <span>Me</span></h2>
            <h3>I'm a<span> Marketing Graduate and a aspiring Full-stack developer</span></h3>
            <p>Hi there! I am a Marketing graduate from the Cape Peninsula University of Technology, where I completed my Advanced Diploma in Marketing in 2023. 
            While my academic foundation is rooted in marketing principles and business strategy, I have recently developed a strong interest in technology, particularly web development, which I have taught myself using platforms such as GitHub and Visual Studio Code.
            </p>
            <p>Since 2019, during my first year of university, I have been blogging on WordPress about topics related to branding, student life, and digital culture. 
            This experience naturally led me into content creation on TikTok, where I now produce mock campaigns, test popular trends, and share relatable content focused on audience engagement and brand visibility.
            </p>
            <p>In my spare time, I enjoy enrolling in online courses that help me grow both professionally and personally. I am especially interested in the following areas:</p>

            <p>
                    - Market Information and Analytics (Statistical Analysis, Quantitative and Qualitative Research)
                    - Management and Finance for Marketers
                    - Branding and Communication
                    - UX and UI Design
                    - Front-end Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
                    - Copywriting
                    - Other subjects that enhance my understanding of marketing and technology
            </p>
            <p>I am passionate about combining creativity with strategy to build meaningful digital experiences and drive impactful marketing campaigns.</p>
